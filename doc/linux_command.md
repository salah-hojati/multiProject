It seems like you're facing a Permission Denied error while trying to initialize a Git repository in /testProject. The issue likely stems from not having the appropriate write permissions to that directory.
âœ… Solution 1: Check Permissions

Make sure you have write permissions for the directory /testProject. You can use the following command to check and update permissions:

ls -ld /testProject  # Check permissions

If you don't have write permissions, change them using:

sudo chmod +w /testProject  # Grant write permissions

Alternatively, if the directory is owned by another user or root, you can change the ownership:

sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /testProject  # Change ownership to your user
